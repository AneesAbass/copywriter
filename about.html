        your support for copywriting services and brand messaging strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m on a mission to help courageous brands that care communicate their
        ‘why’ and embody their voice so they can make a positive impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe you’ve been told you need a flashy looking website or that you
        need to post on Instagram 10 times a week. But what you really need are
        the <span class="highlight">right words</span> to get your audience to
        rally with you and stand beside you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through copy that exudes human connection, clarity and creativity, you
        can strategically sell without being salesy (I know right, it
        <em>is</em> possible!).
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m here to help you confidently represent your brand personality the
        way you’ve always dreamt of and get your inspiring message out there to
        more people who need you most.

        <p>
          I wasn't always reading books or writing my own travel blogs. I don’t
          have a journalism degree, and I didn’t win any storytelling awards at
          school — although I was jealous of the kids who did.
        </p>
        <p>In fact, I didn’t even know I could write.</p>
        <p>
          I was always artsy fartsy, lived for media studies class and had my
          rock music blaring headphones super-glued on instead of my face
          buried in a book.
        </p>
        <p>
          After nearly a decade working as a graphic designer and finished
          artist, I realised the work I was doing made me feel like I wasn’t
          making the world a better place. Product packaging full of plastic,
          advertising for consumer products and concepts that felt unoriginal or
          ‘nothing special’. I was so burnt out that I craved the simple life.
          So, I swapped the paintbrush for the apron and got a job at a
          chocolate shop.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was here that I realised I was a selling star. I enjoyed conversing
          with customers, building relationships, describing products and
          helping them select special gifts. Closing the sale was fun and
          rewarding — seeing them get so excited to rip open that bag of
          chocolate almonds before they even made it out the door.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt like I was actually helping people. It wasn’t just chocolate.
          It was memories. It was joy. It was quality. It was happiness.

      But then, the pandemic happened — that old chestnut
    </h2>
    <div class="pandemic-text">
      <p>
        I fell down a rabbit hole of online learning and became obsessed with
        creative copywriting services, tone of voice and brand messaging. Like,
        I mean obsessed — I couldn’t even sleep because I was so happy that I
        found something I was head over heels for. So, one day, I was like, “I
        could totally have my own freelance business.” And that was that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love infusing my creative mind with my sales and customer service
        skills to give growing businesses the words that sell in the authentic
        and ethical way that’s true to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I work with brands and businesses that want to connect with their
        audience on a deeper level, be memorable and make their mark. Because
        they have something meaningful to share and something purposeful to do.
        I’m here to help get it out there!
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve helped clients in the e-commerce, health and wellness, pet health
        and creative services space feel more confident in their words and
        communicate their message to their dream audience — clearer than ever
        before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like you, I’m building a business I’m passionate about where I can
        help people. Giving them positive transformations and a voice to be
        heard so that they can help others, too.
      </p>
      <p>Thank you for hopping aboard this journey with me.</p>
