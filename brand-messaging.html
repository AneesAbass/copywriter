    <!-- Value Section -->
  <section class="value-section">
    <div class="value-container">
      <h2 class="value-heading">Make no mistake.</h2>
      <p>
        It’s not just words on a page. Words are trust, connection, desire and empathy. 
        All things you need to create so your customer knows you’re the one for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        People don’t just buy a product or service anymore. 
        They buy a promise, transformation or a result. Now more than ever, customers 
        want to feel like someone truly gets them and aligns with their values. 
        So buckle up because they’re steering this ship and setting the rules!
      </p>
      <p>
        In a world where an emotionless bot like Chat GPT can spit out ‘good enough’, 
        average copy in a jiffy, it can be tempting to use it without a second thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        But you’ll run the risk of confusing messaging, wishy-washy words, 
        a forgettable impression and fewer conversions. 
        In other words, you’ll be broke. You might as well just hand over your audience 
        to your competitors.

<!-- Messaging Foundation Section -->
<section class="messaging-section">
  <div class="messaging-container">
    <h2 class="messaging-heading">
      Your brand messaging and tone of voice guide underpin everything!
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is the ripple effect that pulsates through all your copy and content. 
      It is the unique way you speak to your dream customer or client’s soul. 
      It is the foundation you need to be able to resonate with your audience, 
      magnify your impact, create your community and instil your message.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe you already have an idea of your brand personality and tone of voice, 
      but you’re not sure how to refine it, embody it or use it properly. 
      Or maybe you didn’t even know you needed one because you were told 
      it was all about your visual branding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just imagine a brand you’re obsessed with for a moment. 
      You feel like they were created just for you, right? 
      How do you think they got to where they are today? 
      They put blood, sweat and tears into their messaging, marketing, 
      presence and communication to make their mark and stand out.
    </p>

<!-- Your Turn Section -->
<section class="yourturn-section">
  <div class="yourturn-container">
    <h2 class="yourturn-heading">now, it’s your turn.</h2>
    <p>
      Because, at the moment, your copy sounds like a mixed bag of 
      <em>‘what the f am I doing?’</em> and <em>“I can’t even”</em>. 
      Luckily, I’ll do the hard work for you (no blood, sweat or tears on your end).
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ll dive into the deepest depths and find the gold for unmatched brand clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ll create a <span class="highlight">brand bible</span> (aka your tone of voice guideline) 
      for you with the essential puzzle pieces to build the big picture, 
      refine your message, showcase your points of difference, and make fans for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crafted by a human so that you can help other humans.
