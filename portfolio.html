      SARAH BREGEL — <span>FACEBOOK ADS COPYWRITING</span>

    <p class="project-intro">
      Sarah Bregel is a <strong>growth-focused entrepreneur</strong> helping businesses scale online.  
      She had a strong product, solid offers, and a loyal audience — but her Facebook ads weren’t converting the way they should.
    </p>
    <p class="project-intro">
      Her visuals were polished, but the messaging didn’t grab attention fast enough or create that “must-click” urgency.

        Sarah came to me with a challenge: <strong>ads that looked good but didn’t sell consistently.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        My job was to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        Create scroll-stopping hooks that stop people mid-feed.<br>
        Write copy that speaks directly to the audience’s desires and pain points.<br>
        Turn features and offers into benefits people actually care about.<br>
        Test variations that could be optimized for engagement and conversions.
      </ul>
